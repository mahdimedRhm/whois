                I'm a full-stack developer based in Lyon ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·. I'm the Tech Lead at Steadfast Collective, where we build community-focused websites and web applications. <br><br>
                My professional journey started in 2014, shortly after I graduated with a Computer Science and Engineering degree, in Portugal. I then moved to the UK for an internship, that turned into a full-time job, building WordPress websites for many clients.<br> After a while, I moved on to a PHP developer role at Steadfast Collective, where we build Laravel websites and web applications using Laravel, Vuejs and TailwindCSS as the primary tech stack. In the meanwhile, I moved to France and got a new role at the company. <br><br>

                Even though the previously mentioned stack is my favourite, I also love learning new things, and I do, sometimes, spend some time exploring new tech or tools. <br><br>

                Outside of work, I like to spend time with family, spend time in nature, sports, gaming and many other things. I have recently been enjoying participating in artisan workshops to learn to make something with my own hands! <br><br>
